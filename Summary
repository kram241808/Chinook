Delivery 2:  Top 3 Revenue-Generating Genres
--  There are tracks with no price (i.e., Null).  SQLite documentation states the SUM ignores NULL values in the SUM() function.
-- This results in the following genres and revenue
-- Rock $826.65
-- Latin $382.14
-- Metal $261.36
-- Note:  In a real scenario, I would investigate how the music genres are defined (e.g., rock vs rock and roll vs metal)
