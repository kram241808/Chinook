-- Summary Report
The results of the 5 queries are presented below.  A casual review of the data and results were performed. 
But given the data was contrived and the goal of this project is to learn and demonstrate basic SQL, 
no deep analysis was performed.  Nevertheless, I have discussed some information that gives some 
understanding of the results where it seems needed.
