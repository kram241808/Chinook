Project to demonstrate data analysis using SQL on the Chinook SQLite database.  ChatGPT was used to create the scenario, but not the actual SQL commands.

# Mini-Project: Chinook Revenue Insights Dashboard
Project Scenario:
You have been hired as a data analyst for the Chinook music store to generate actionable insights for the marketing team. They want to understand:

Who their top customers are

Which genres and artists generate the most revenue

Revenue trends by country

Track pricing insights

You will produce SQL queries and clean output tables to place into Google Sheets/Excel or Power BI/Tableau for a simple dashboard.

🪐 Project Objectives:
✅ 1️⃣ Identify Top Customers by Revenue

List customer name, email, and total spending.

Sort in descending order to highlight top customers.

Use aggregation and joins.

✅ 2️⃣ Find Top 3 Revenue-Generating Genres

Calculate total sales per genre.

Rank genres by revenue.

Requires joins across genres, tracks, invoice_items and aggregation.

✅ 3️⃣ Analyze Revenue by Country Above Average

Calculate average revenue per country.

Identify countries with above-average revenue.

Use subqueries for filtering.

✅ 4️⃣ Track Pricing Analysis

Find tracks priced above the average unit price.

Display track name, album, artist, genre, and unit price.

Combines joins, subqueries, and aggregation.

✅ 5️⃣ BONUS: Customer Purchase Frequency vs. Revenue

Identify customers with high frequency but low spending and low frequency but high spending.

Useful for marketing targeting.

🪄 Deliverables:
1️⃣ SQL Queries for each objective, stored in your GitHub or Notion.
2️⃣ Clean CSV exports for visualization.
3️⃣ Summary insights:

“Top customers contribute X% of total revenue.”

“Rock genre leads revenue by $X.”

“Countries A, B, C are above average, suggesting market potential.”

“Tracks priced above average make up X% of catalog.”

4️⃣ Optional: Visualize:

Bar charts (top customers, top genres).

Pie chart (genre revenue share).

Map (revenue by country).

🛠️ Tools for Execution:
✅ Use sqliteonline.com or DB Browser for SQLite to run queries.
✅ Use Google Sheets/Excel to organize and visualize outputs.
✅ Document:

Your problem statements

Your SQL queries (as code blocks or screenshots)

Visual outputs with labels

Insights (1–2 sentences per finding)

✅ Add this to your portfolio with a clean README:

“Chinook Revenue Insights Dashboard”

What was analyzed, why, and business insights.

🚀 Next Steps:
1️⃣ Pick Objective 1 and attempt it first.
2️⃣ Let me know if you need hints or table relationship clarifications as you build each query.
3️⃣ Once finished with all objectives, I can help you refine visuals and interpret the business meaning for your portfolio narrative.
