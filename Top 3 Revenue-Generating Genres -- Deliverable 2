-- Top 3 Revenue-Generating Genres
--  There are tracks with no price (i.e., Null).  SQLite documentation states the SUM ignores NULL values in the SUM() function.
-- This results in the following genres and revenue
-- Rock $826.65
-- Latin $382.14
-- Metal $261.36
-- Note:  In a real scenario, I would investigate how the music genres are defined (e.g., rock vs rock and roll vs metal)

SELECT g.Name, SUM(i.UnitPrice*i.Quantity) AS Revenue

LEFT JOIN Tracks t
ON g.genreId = t.genreId
LEFT JOIN invoice_items i
ON t.trackId = i.trackId
GROUP BY g.genreId
ORDER BY Revenue DESC
LIMIT 3
